A desktop client for [Yume Nikki Online](https://ynoproject.net/) with optional Discord Rich Presence. Show your friends what game you're playing and what room you're in. Also looks pretty cool as an installed program.

Created as a simple Electron wrapper around the website, with optional `discord-rpc` integration and some hacks to make save exporting/importing work.

## Features

- Optional Discord Rich Presence to display your game status and room information to friends on Discord.
- Easy installation and setup.
- Smooth integration with Yume Nikki Online.
